#### Description

The notebooks are based on the examples and exercises that were taught at Jimmy Song seminar *Programming Blockchain*. 

Check out [Jimmy's blog!](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/)

[Update] Jimmy created his own exercise notebooks: https://github.com/jimmysong/pb-exercises

#### How to start

Run the following commands:

```
sudo pip install pycoin
sudo pip install jupyter
git clone https://github.com/sahabi/programming-blockchain.git
cd programming-blockchain
jupyter notebook
```

On your browser you can select the notebook. 

Notebooks were tested only on Python 2.7 and Ubuntu 14.04.


#### TODO

- [ ] Python 3 compatibility
- [ ] Include the answers to the excercises. Maybe in a seperate notebook?
- [ ] Fix the encryption example in Session 2
